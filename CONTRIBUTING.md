SPIN uses GitHub to manage reviews of pull requests.

* If you have a trivial fix or improvement, go ahead and create a pull
  request.
  
* If you find a bug, like to suggest an enhancement or have any other issue, please create an issue in Github.

* If you plan to get otherwise involved, for example discuss your ideas, there is also a
  [mailing list](https://mailman.sidn.nl/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/spin).
  This will avoid unnecessary work and surely give you and us a good deal
  of inspiration.
